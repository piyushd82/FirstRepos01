    "1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "Ans: Inheritance acquiring properties, behavior from the base class. On top of it derived class can have their set of attributes and method. However the visibility for those limited to derived class only. On the other hand anything intorduced to base/parent class it will be available to derived/child class. Child class may or maynot use method content defined in parent class. In short it can be rewrite.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOPs, It is one of core concept. It will give developer to defined base class with attributes and methods which can be used by mutiple dervied class. It means common set of attributes and methods extended to get implemented in derived class. In case of any changes required than it can be done at place and applicability extended to all derived class. Aprt from this derived class can have their own specific methods and attribute. Any deviation of method at derived class limited to scope to derived class only."

    "Single Inheritance: As name suggested, it inherits details from only one class. That approach ensures reusability, simplified parent child hierarchy \n",

    "- Promotes code reuse and modular design.\n",
